# HASH

HASH stands for Hardware Acceleration of Secure Hashing. This repo is an engineering study of SHA-256 algorithm parallelized using python and pyCUDA. 

The cpu source code (developed with anaconda python 3.7) implementation adapts from the SHA-256 wikipedia artcile pseudocode here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2#Pseudocode

contact: cb3534@columbia.edu

The cpu implementation is unit tested and is consistent with hashing algorithms that can be found online.
